Inputs:

income, expenses, purchase price, interest rate, loan amount, interest only, amortization


Outputs:

net operating income, debt service, cash flow, cash on cash, capitalization rate, down payment, debt service coverage ratio, loan to value


Equations:

(net operating income) = (income) - (expenses)

if (interest only) == Yes
    (debt service) = (interest rate) / 100 * (loan amount)
else
    (debt service) = PMT[ (interest rate) / 100, (amortization), -(loan amount) ]
end

(cash flow) = (net operating income) - (debt service)

(debt service coverage ratio) = (net operating income) / (debt service)

(cash on cash) = (cash flow) / (down payment)

(capitalization rate) = (net operating income) / (purchase price) * 100

(loan to value) = (loan amount) / (purchase price) * 100

(down payment) = (purchase price) - (loan amount)
