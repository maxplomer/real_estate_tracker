Inputs:

income, expenses, purchase price, interest rate, loan amount


Outputs:

net operating income, debt service, cash flow, cash on cash, capitalization rate, down payment


Equations:

(net operating income) = (income) - (expenses)

(debt service) = (interest rate) / 100 * (loan amount)

(cash flow) = (net operating income) - (debt service)

(cash on cash) = (cash flow) / (down payment)

(capitalization rate) = (net operating income) / (purchase price)

(down payment) = (purchase price) - (loan amount)
